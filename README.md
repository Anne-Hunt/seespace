# APOD Project for React, Vite, and NASA APOD API

This application uses the free NASA APOD API, React.js, and Vite to create a website that displays the daily content of NASA's Picture Of The Day program. 

Future versions will include a date selector, better alignment of HD images, and the modal will also be less disruptive to the overall layout.
